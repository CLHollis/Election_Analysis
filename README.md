# Election Analysis

## Project Overview 
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election. 

1.	Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Get a complete list of candidates who received votes and counties that voted.
3.	Calculate the total number of votes each candidate received.
4.	Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5.	Calculate which county had the highest voter turnout.
6.	Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
-	Data Source: [election_results.csv](https://github.com/CLHollis/Election_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/election_results.csv)
-	Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code, 1.63.0

## Summary
This script can be used‚Äîwith some modifications‚Äîfor any election. 
- One way is to use a different data set with the same criteria (counties, votes, and/or candidtates) but adding raw data for these criteria. For example, adding another candidate, gathering more votes, or adding more counties. 
- Another way is to find the breakdown of another variable of the voters such as: ethnicity, income, gender, or any other census-type question that is asked on the ballot and tracked. First you would initialize a variable for the new criteria, like "voter_ethnicity." Then repeat the code from the county (or candidate) stats, but substitute in your new variable. For example, replace the word "county" for "voter_ethnicity."     
    
## Technical Syntax

- **Find number of total votes:**
    ```
    # Initialize a total vote counter.
    total_votes = 0
    
    # Print and save to text file.
    f"Total Votes: {total_votes:,}
    print(election_results, end="")
    txt_file.write(total_votes)
    ```
    
- **Find County Vote count and percentage:**  * *"County: percentage of total votes (total number of votes)"* *
    ```
    # Create a county list and county votes dictionary.
    county_name = []
    county_votes = {}
    
        # Inside the for loop, going row buy row, Extract the county name from each row.
        county = row[1]
    
        # Write an if statement that checks that the county does not match any existing county in the county list.
        if county not in county_name:
            # Add the existing county to the list of counties.
            county_name.append(county)
            # Begin tracking the county's vote count.
            county_votes[county] = 0
        # Add a vote to that county's vote count.
         county_votes[county] += 1
    
    # Write a for loop to get the county from the county dictionary.
    with open(file_to_save, "w") as txt_file:

         # Save the county votes to a text file.
        txt_file.write(county_results)

        if (area_votes > most_votes):
            most_votes = area_votes
            largest_county = county
    ```
    
- **Which county had the largest number of votes?**
    ```
